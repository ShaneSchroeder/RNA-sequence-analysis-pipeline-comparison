Analyzing The Effects of Hdac6-/- on Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Homeostasis in Mouse Bone Marrow using Two Different RNA-sequence analysis pipelines. Our results are detailed in this [PDF](https://github.com/ShaneSchroeder/RNA-sequence-analysis-pipeline-comparison/blob/main/The%20Effects%20of%20Hdac6-%3A-%20on%20Hematopoietic%20Stem%20and%20Progenitor%20Cell%20Homeostasis%20in%20Mouse%20Bone%20Marrow.pdf)

# Instructions on running the two pipelines and generating results
Please look at at [these instructions]([https://github.com/ShaneSchroeder/RNA-sequence-analysis-pipeline-comparison/blob/main/InstructionsForRunningPipeline.pdf).
# Note
These pipelines were executed on a High-performance Compute cluster at Miami University running CentOS and preinstalled packages, there will be additional setup for
others attempting to run these pipelines.
